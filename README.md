## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Edit scripting hooks in the `src/mygame.ts` file.
4. Build for deployment with `npm run build`.
5. Copy content of the `dist/*.js` files to the AI Dungeon script editor.

Other commands:

* `npm run lint` - Lint the code with ESLint and TypeScript.
